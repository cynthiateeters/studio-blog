I recently reviewed student submissions where every project had a single commit: "Finish assignment."

The work itself was good. But this is a habit worth changing early.

## What single commits look like

```text
0fe5909 Finish markdown assignment
```

## What incremental commits look like

```text
a1b2c3d Add name and studying sections
d4e5f6g Complete programming experience list
g7h8i9j Add goals and fun fact
j0k1l2m Fill out AI collaboration summary
m3n4o5p Final review and cleanup
```

## Why this matters

**Safety net.** If you break something, you can go back to a working version.

**Learning record.** You can see how your thinking evolved.

**Professional practice.** In team environments, clear commit history helps others understand your work.

**Debugging.** When something stops working, you can find exactly when it broke.

A good rule of thumb: if you'd be upset to lose what you just wrote, commit it.

## Commit message conventions

Notice the messages say "Add" not "Added." Git convention uses the imperative mood—write commits as commands.

Think of it as completing the sentence: "If applied, this commit will... _add name and studying sections_."

This style fits perfectly with Pull Requests. When you open a PR, GitHub shows your commit messages as a list of things that will happen when merged.

## One-line vs multi-line

Short commits need just one line. For bigger changes, use a subject line, a blank line, then a body:

```text
Add email field to user data schema

Update data.json to include optional email property.
Modify display component to show email when present.
```

The first line shows in git log summaries; the body provides context.

## AI can help with Git

Those sparkles in VS Code sometimes generate terrible commit messages. Don't just accept them.

Instead, ask your AI assistant to suggest a message, then refine it together. You can even ask it to handle the commit and push once you're happy.

Git has about 160 commands. I know maybe 15. AI knows them all. Use that.

## Why this matters for your career

Don't be surprised if a future employer browses your GitHub repos—including your commit messages—to see how you work.

Clean, consistent commits signal professionalism.
